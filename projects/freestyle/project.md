# Group "Freestyle" Project

In groups of two to four, students will propose, plan and implement their own custom web-based business technology products of interest.

## Objectives

  1. Engage in a deliberate lifecycle of software planning, design, and implementation.
  2. Produce a web-based technology product for business purposes.
  3. Leverage technology as an outlet for creativity.
  4. Have fun!

## Requirements

Students have a large degree of flexibility in choosing what kind of product to deliver, however it should meet at least the following criteria:

  1. Serve some practical business purpose
  2. Either A) leverage Internet technologies introduced in this course (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and/or Python), or B) leverage data shared programmatically over the Internet (for example from a third-party API or website)

Acceptable products include, but are not limited to:

  + Website (beginner)
  + Web Application (intermediate)
  + API Client that gets its data by issuing HTTP requests to a third-party API (intermediate)
  + Web Scraper that gets its data by issuing HTTP requests to a third-party website (intermediate)
  + Mobile Application (advanced)

## Instructions and Deliverables

### Group Selection

Each student should fill out this [Group Selection Form](https://forms.gle/qeiqW1o6XQgYjEyk9) by the designated due date. The form asks whether you already have a group you'd like to work with, or whether you'd like the professor to match you with a group. Even if you have a pre-selected team, all team members should fill out the form separately. The form also asks about any preliminary project ideas you may have.

### Planning and Design Document

After your group compositions are approved or assigned by the professor, gather with your teammates to ideate a potential web-based product that can serve one or more practical business purposes. This can be a website or web application, or it can be a program that makes use of data from another third-party website or API.

Create a planning document in PDF format which details the business objective(s) of your product. The planning document should also describe who your users are, how they'll use the product, and why.

As applicable, design the look and feel of your product by creating drawings or other illustrative representations. You may choose to use pencil and paper, whiteboard, or digital design tools. If your design documents don't start in digital format, take a picture or otherwise scan them into digital format. Then embed them into your Planning and Design Document.

By the designated due date, upload your Planning and Design Document [to Canvas](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/104329/assignments/374352).

### Implementation

Once you are satisfied with the planned objectives of the product and its ability to meet those objectives as designed, begin developing your product.

If you're developing a website or web application, you may use a front-end web development framework
 like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn)
 to reduce development efforts and conform to familiar web standards. Regardless of what kind of product you're making, you may also leverage any starter project code provided by the professor as the basis of your own product. If you're not sure where to start, feel free to ask the professor for support, including for example code to help you get started!

Continue developing your product until you are satisfied with its ability to meet its stated objectives. If the stated objectives are large in scope, it's OK to implement a small sub-component of the overall functionality.

If your project is a website or web app, it should ideally be hosted and available for public consumption over the Internet. Websites should be hosted via GitHub Pages, while web applications should be hosted on a Heroku server.

Your final project code should reside in a repository on GitHub. By the designated due date, submit the [Project Submission Form](https://forms.gle/pKhPM3N2zqMUisga9) and specify the URL to your project repository.

### Presentation

During the designated class period, deliver a seven minute presentation to describe your product and demonstrate its implementation. The implementation need not be entirely complete by this time, but ideally you'll have at least some functionality to show.

### Peer Review

Attend class on the designated presentation day, and fill out a Peer Review Form to evaluate each other group presentation.
