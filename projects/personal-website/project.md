# Website Project

## Objectives

  1. Engage in a deliberate lifecycle of website planning, design, and implementation.
  2. Produce a static website from conception to delivery.
  3. Leverage technology as an outlet for creativity.

## Instructions

Plan, design, and develop a website for personal or professional purposes. The website can feature a person, place, or business, or serve some other purpose. The website's content can be real or fictitious.

You are encouraged to leverage a front-end web development framework
 like [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
 to reduce development efforts.

### Requirements

The website should include at least three different pages, and maintain consistent style and navigation across pages.

The website should contain each of the following HTML elements:

   + Headings (i.e. `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
   + Dividers (i.e. `<div>`)
   + Paragraphs (i.e. `<p>`)
   + Hyperlinks (i.e. `<a>`)
   + Lists (i.e. `<ul>` or `<ol>`, in conjunction with multiple `<li>` elements)
   + Images (i.e. `<img>`)
   + [HTML5 Semantic Elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) (i.e. `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, etc.)

The website should use at least one CSS stylesheet, either internal or external.

The website should ideally be "responsive" when the window is resized, for example to a mobile device width.

### Planning

Your website must exist for one or more practical purposes, even if fictitious. First create a planning document which details the objective(s) of your website. What information should it convey? To whom? Optionally include a copy of your planning document in your project repository in a directory called `/planning`.

### Design

Then design the look and feel of your website by producing drawings or other illustrative representations. You may choose to use pencil and paper, whiteboard, digital design tools, etc. If your design documents don't start in digital format, take a picture or otherwise scan them into digital format. Optionally include all design documents in your project repository in a directory called `/design`.

### Implementation

Once you are satisfied with planning and designing, begin developing your website.

Continue developing your website until you are satisfied. Incrementally save new versions of your website code via the GitHub Desktop software.

Ensure the website is hosted and available for public consumption on the Internet.

## Evaluation

Websites will be evaluated according to the requirements set forth above, as summarized by the rubric below:

Category | Requirement | Weight
--- | --- | ---
Website Hosting | Website is publicly accessible on the Internet (i.e. hosted via GitHub Pages). | 20%
Website Structure | Website has proper me | 15%
Website Structure | Website has at least three navigable pages, with consistent navigation across all pages. | 15%
Website Structure | HTML documents are reasonably organized, including the specified elements and HTML5 semantic elements. | 15%
Website Style | Website is reasonably well styled and "responsive" when window width is resized. | 15%
User Experience | Website contains a creative and unique set of content. | 15%
Dev Process | Submitted via remote Git repository which reflects an incremental revision history | 20%

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.

If experiencing navigation or functionality error(s) while evaluating the website, evaluators are advised to reduce the grade by between 4% and 25%, depending on the circumstances and severity of the error(s).

In recognition of deliverables which exhibit functionality above and beyond the basic requirements, evaluators are encouraged to award between 4% and 15% "engagement points" to be applied as extra credit.
