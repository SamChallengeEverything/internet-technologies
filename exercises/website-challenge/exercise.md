## Prerequisites

  1. ["Website Hosting" Exercise](/exercises/website-hosting/exercise.md)

## Objectives

You've been hired by a juice company to modernize their web presence. The company currently uses printed brochures and in-store displays to communicate their menu of juice products to customers.

Your mission is to convert their printed brochure into a website, so they can share their menu of juice products with the world!

> NOTE: this prompt is fictional, however all menu items and images are copyright of [The Juice Laundry](https://www.thejuicelaundry.com/menu).

> NOTE: If you'd like to alternatively use your own menu / brochure, feel free to do so, just upload a photo of the original menu somewhere in your repo.

Your website need not be an exact replica of the brochure, but should rather draw inspiration and content from the brochure to generally accomplish the objectives. In other words, you are encouraged to make your own decisions about the website's layout and design.


## Instructions

### Making a Plan

First, take a few moments to sketch your desired website layout and design onto a piece of paper or a whiteboard. You can refer to this desired design sketch to keep you on track when developing the site.

### Setting up the Repository

Then, follow the setup steps from the ["Website Structure" Exercise](/exercises/website-structure/exercise.md), which ask you to create a new repository on GitHub, download or "clone" the repository onto your local computer, open the repository in a text editor, create a new "index.html" file, and auto-generate the default HTML scaffolding in that file.

### Using Provided Images

You may use any of the [provided images](images/), as long as somewhere in the footer of your website you note that the images are copyright of The Juice Laundry, like:

```html
<p>
  Images &copy; <a href="https://www.thejuicelaundry.com">The Juice Laundry</a>, used here for instructional purposes.
</p>
```

In order to use the images, you can either:

  A) Download or "clone" this entire course repository locally onto your computer and copy / paste the relevant images into your own website repository, OR

  B) View any image on GitHub and click the "download" button to download that image, then move it into your own website repository, OR

  C) View any image on GitHub and right-click on it to "Copy Image Address" and use that URL as the image source (no need to download into your own website repository)

### Developing the Website

Use your HTML and CSS knowledge to iteratively develop the contents of your "index.html" page.

You may leverage Twitter Bootstrap or any other front-end frameworks, as desired.

### Deploying the Website

Follow the same steps outlined in the "Publishing" section of the ["Website Hosting" Exercise](/exercises/website-hosting/exercise.md) to configure GitHub Pages to host your website so it is publicly-accessible over the Internet.

Then share your link with the rest of the class via Slack to show off your great work!
