# "Website Hosting" Exercise

Leverage an existing open source website to publish your own.

> Note: your website content will be accessible to the public.

## Objectives

  1. Develop a familiarity with open source software, software version control, and website hosting.
  2. Gain exposure to a basic website, noting its directory structure and observing HTML document structures and content.
  3. Obtain a foundation upon which to develop and publish your own personal website, for free.
  4. Leverage technology as an outlet for creativity.

## Prerequisites

  + Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, unless you already have one. New users make sure to verify your email address by clicking the confirmation link sent via email.
  + Download a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  + Download the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) software.

## Instructions

### Forking a Repository

Sign in to GitHub and navigate to the professor's [Student Site](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/student-site) repository. This repository contains an "index.html" file and other HTML files which comprise a basic website.

Click the "fork" button to create a copy of the repository under your own control. Navigate to your forked repository's homepage on GitHub, if necessary.

Great, now you have an example website.

### Configuring Hosting

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers a free mechanism for hosting your website, but must first be configured.

Navigate to your forked repository's "Settings" menu on GitHub, and scroll down to find the section called "GitHub Pages". Select the "main" branch from the drop-down, and click "save". Visit the resulting GitHub Pages URL, which should resemble `https://USERNAME.github.io/student-site/`, where `USERNAME` is your own GitHub username.

Congrats, you've published, or "deployed" the site! Anytime we save new versions of our site to the repository's "main" branch, it will trigger a re-building of our hosted site.

> NOTE: sometimes it can take a few minutes for new changes to be reflected at the GitHub Pages URL.


### Downloading the Repository

We need to download the repository so we can modify and preview the files.

From your forked repository's homepage on GitHub, click the green button to "Open with GitHub Desktop". Choose to save it in a location like your Desktop. If prompted, indicate you are planning to use this fork "For my own purposes", otherwise choose this setting later via the GitHub Desktop "Repository" settings. Open the local repository in GitHub Desktop, if necessary.

From GitHub Desktop, test your ability to view the files


### Making Changes

Open the repository with your text editor. Open the "about.html" file in your text editor.

Change some of the page's content, such as the student's name. Remember to save the file before previewing the changes.

### Previewing Changes

Open the repository with your operating system's file explorer / finder.

Right-click on the "index.html" page or any other to view its contents in the browser.

### Publishing Changes

Optionally repeat the process of making and previewing changes.

When you are satisfied with your changes, use the GitHub Desktop to make a "commit" (save a new version).

After making a commit, push your changes to the "origin" repo, which should trigger a re-build of your GitHub pages site.



### Visiting

Re-visit the GitHub Pages URL, and navigate to the "about" page, where you should see your changes.

Congratulations, you've published a website! You are encouraged to further edit its content, structure, and style to reflect your own personality and suit your own purposes.
