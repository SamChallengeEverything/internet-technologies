# "Web Scraper" Exercise

## Prerequisites

  + [Python Development Environment Setup](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/units/unit-0.md), including installing Python via Anaconda. Command-line computing exercise optional.
  + ["Run the App" Exercise](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/exercises/run-the-app/README.md) to demonstrate your ability to run an example Python application and verify Python is installed properly
  + Reference Notes:
    + [The `requests` Python Package](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/python/packages/requests.md)
    + [The `beautifulsoup` Python Package](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/python/packages/beautifulsoup.md)

## Objectives

  + Practice running Python programs
  + Learn how to create Python applications to issue HTTP requests to parse the contents of web pages
  + Observe the relationship between a page's HTML structure and the Python code required to parse it
  + Observe similarities between finding elements in Python and selecting elements in JavaScript

## Instructions

Find a website to scrape. If you're not sure which one would be suitable, choose this page that contains a [list of books by Shakespeare](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/65).

One way to demonstrate our ability to parse its contents would be to write a Python program to identify all the books and output the title of each book.

Before we can write a Python program to parse this web page, we need to examine the HTML structure of the page. Right-click in your browser to inspect the underlying HTML contents of the page. Notice ______________:
